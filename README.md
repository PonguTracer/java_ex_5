# 5. Divisible by 3

---

A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. For example, 153 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 5 + 3 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3.

Write a program that collects three integer inputs representing the place values of a three-digit number. Determines whether the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. If any integer entered is a negative value, output

Invalid input!

Output a formatted message identifying if the three-digit number is divisible by 3, ending with a newline. Ensure your program output matches the example formatting below and works for a variety of input values.

If the input is:

1

5

3

the output is:

153 is divisible by 3!

Alternatively, if the input is:

1

0

4

the output is:

104 is not divisible by 3!

Alternatively, if the input is:

1

- 5

3

the output is:

Invalid input!
